# {{ cookiecutter.project_name | replace("_", " ") | title }} Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! :sparkles:.

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and
respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an
issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New Contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some
resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub][1]
- [Set up Git][2]
- [GitHub flow][3]
- [Collaborating with pull requests][4]

## Getting Started

### Issues

#### Create a New Issue

If you spot a problem with the package, [search if an issue already exists][5]. If a
related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form][6].

#### Solve an Issue

Scan through our [existing issues][6] to find one that interests you. You can narrow
down the search using `labels` as filters. See
[Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. If you find an issue
to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop][7] will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo][8].
2 Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo][9] so that you can make your changes without affecting the original
    project until you're ready to merge them.
3. Run `make install` from within the repo to get set up
4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit Your Update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide][10] to
know how to use emoji for commit messages.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md)
to speed up the review process :zap:

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template
  helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue][11] if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits][12] so the branch can be updated for a
  merge.

Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask
questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested
  changes][13] or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly
  through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your
  branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved][14].
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial][15] to help you resolve
  merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
